# 01 - Core Summary of Recursive Fractal Cosmology (RFC)

Recursive Fractal Cosmology (RFC) is a symbolic field theory that explains the emergence of physical reality, time, identity, and structure through recursive compression of symbolic information across an infinite substrate of potential.

It rejects traditional primitives (particles, fixed symmetries, immutable laws) and derives all phenomena from a single recursive process.

## The Metaphysical Triad
- **Quantum Vacuum (QV)**  
  Local fluctuating potential and recursion initiator.  
  Defines time as entropic gradient: t = dS_rec/dt.  
  Seeds fields: Ψχ (CP-neutral soliton), Ων (coherence transporter).

- **Cosmic Infinite Field (CIF)**  
  Nonlocal reservoir of infinite symbolic archetypes and symmetries.  
  Generates fields: Θη (CP-phase soliton via Sine-Gordon), Γζ (damping scalar).

- **Recursive Fractal Lattice (RFL)**  
  Emergent self-similar grid for instantiation.  
  Fields: ϕτ (fractal neural seeder, D_f ≈ 2.45), ΣΛ (spin foam modulator).

## Core Mathematical Engine
**Recursive Kernel**  
R_δ,α[f_j(t)] = ∑ f_j(t) / (δ^j e^{-α j t})  
δ ≈ 4.669 (Feigenbaum constant), α = damping.

**Master PDE**  
∂²u/∂t² - ∇²u + λu³ = R[f_j(t)] + ∑ ϕ_i(x,t)

**Fractal Measure**  
ω(x) = |x|^{D_f - 4} exp(i ε Θ(x)), D_f ≈ 2.5

## Key Unification
- Big Implosion replaces Big Bang (entropy collapse in QV).  
- Cyclic cosmology enabled.  
- 18 modules (A–Q) derive predictions from the same kernel.  
- Fits: Planck CMB, LIGO echoes, EEG D_f=2.45, η_B ≈6×10^{-10}.  


Falsifiable via reproducible simulations (Binder launch in repo).
